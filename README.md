Sometimes it takes long to search for that one command to debug something or even install a dependency.. I will randomly write them down here

### Set up tailwindcss in react app

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p 
```
The init command generates tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files

psql : error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory 

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```
